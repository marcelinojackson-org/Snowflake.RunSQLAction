# Snowflake.RunSQLAction v1.1.1

## Fixes
- Ensure persisted-result directories are recreated inside the configured path rather than deleting the entire `RUNNER_TEMP` folder (which broke GitHub’s file-command outputs).

No other behavior changes—this patch just makes the new CSV/metadata feature safe on hosted runners.
